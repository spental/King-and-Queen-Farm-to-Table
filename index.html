        <h1>What did your school division do to create this project/program</h1>
        <hr />
        <p> Central High School located in King and Queen Virginia has recently been focusing on student involvement in developing and sustaining a “Farm to Table “mindset within the student body. CTE partnering with Centrals cafeteria to produce a “Farm
            to Table” program allowing students to actively participate in planning, cultivation, and harvesting of familiar crops and vegetables. King and Queens “Farm to Table” mind set recognizes the need to support student access to healthy food options.
            Opportunities to learn, explore, and experience sustaining and developing local gardens will teach learners resiliency, determination, as well as allowing learners to take ownership in something within the school system and community. Career
            and Technology Education classes at Central have partnered with the cafeteria, implementing Hydroponic grow walls within the cafeteria and school. Using an open courtyard in the middle of our school we have been allowed to create raised gardens
            and areas for planting fresh vegetables and flowers. These collaborative spaces stimulate and encourage cross curriculum education, as well as provide social environments for relationship building and social emotional growth. Central would
            like to have students in CTE classes collaborate with agriculture, Biology, Environmental science, and the Cafeteria to continue promoting collaboration and hands on learning environments focused on producing healthy, strong, relevant members
            of society and food!

        <h1>How did the project/program help reduce childhood hunger, provide healthy school meals to students, or encourage wellness and physical activity?</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
            <H5>King and Queens “Farm to Table” mind set recognizes the need to support student access to healthy food options. Providing a complete well-rounded education to Students is the main focus of King and Queen County. King and Queen truly believes
                that giving a child food will feed them for the day. If you teach a child how to grow their food they can eat for a lifetime. King and Queen survives from its agriculture roots focusing on Grain, bean, and soy beans. Farm to Table programs
                within our community are stimulating and encouraging students to take interest in farming and food production. Learners in our community take what they have learned from class and implement these new skills and this new education at home,
                starting gardens and mini farms. These new skills have allowed students to grow gardens at home providing fresh local produce for them and their families; This also has the benefit of a reduced necessity for local stores providing fresh
                produce or the need for excessive travel to access fresh healthy foods. Due to King and Queens rural location access to clean, fresh, healthy foods is very limited. With a Median income Per capita (2019) of $ 31,000. Exposing students
                to new ways of providing and sustaining food and resources is key to future success within this community. Expunging future community members reliance upon commercial nutrition and resources will allow community members, families, and
                students to have autonomy, and develop life skills that provide powerful and important lessons that can be generationally passed down to future students and community members. Covid-19 has impacted our learners in many unforeseeable ways,
                staying inside has been a new normal for many students. Staying inside in climate-controlled safety has been a main focus for many students. Playing video games, chatting on zoom and face time, creating tick tocks and snap chats is all
                the rage with our youth. Getting students outside, building gardens, planting flowers and vegetables, creating areas for livestock has encouraged socialization within our student body. Students are taking saplings grown at school with
                friends, and planting them at home, creating home gardens and sharing their new knowledge with individuals in the community. Students are benefiting from this agriculture initiative through socialization with other learners, gaining self-confidence
                by creating areas that produce physical and tangible results, and learning resiliency skills to become better productive members of society.
